# What is Digital Forensics?

## Quick Summary
Digital forensics is one of the most exciting branches of computer science. It can help uncover crime, catch threat actors, prevent attacks, and even save lives!

### What is digital forensics?
Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that constitutes three main actions: **identifying**, **acquiring**, and **analyzing** digitally stored data.

There are two principal areas in digital forensics: **law enforcement** and **digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)**. Forensics investigators will use different techniques and tools to gather electronic evidence and report it to the appropriate authorities. Digital forensics can be used in law enforcement investigations to help prosecute criminals and to provide evidence in court. It's also used as part of **DFIR**, where investigations might not necessarily lead to a court case.

DFIR is important for revealing how cyber incidents occur. Uncovering the steps and methods used by cybercriminals can help organizations identify security gaps and work towards a better security posture.

### The need for digital forensics
Digital forensics is used to prove that something has happened and to validate a hypothesis. Investigating digital information can provide insights into cyberattacks, such as identifying a criminal’s motives and intents. In other cases, it can help trace malicious actions and identify digital artifacts (such as event logs, files, and registry keys) that can prevent future attacks. Digital forensics can also help with data recovery in case of accidental or intentional damage.

### Types of digital forensics
Digital forensics is a broad term, and more subdivisions have been created over the years. Generally, these are the following branches:

(The two categories below refer to the volatility of the data inspected. In other words, they depend on whether the device is turned on or off during the investigation).

**Live** – refers to the process of investigating devices while they're still turned on. This is because the type of information you can acquire from a device depends on the type of memory that's targeted; whether it's volatile or non-volatile. Live forensics focuses on volatile memory.

**Static** – the opposite of live forensics, also known as dead-box forensics. It targets non-volatile memory, meaning that the device can remain switched off during the investigation.

(The following categories focus on the sources or devices under inspection).

**Computer** – refers to traditional digital forensics, which involves investigating a compromised computer device such as a desktop computer, laptop, or a server, and examining its hardware and software parts. This can be live or static, depending on which part of a computer you're inspecting.

**Mobile** – the examination of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Mobile devices typically use different operating systems than computers and laptops, so specialized mobile forensics tools may be required. Mobile forensics can also be static or live.

**Network** – expands from one device to a combination of multiple devices that form a network. This branch of forensics involves monitoring the traffic between devices and examining the exchange of live information. It's also possible to have a static copy of traffic in the form of a packet capture.

**Malware** – involves investigating malicious software and breaking it down to understand its base operations. This branch of forensics is useful for incident responders, as it helps them to uncover the nature of a cyber threat or even the adversary behind it. You can perform static malware analysis to inspect a malware's code and conduct a live analysis to observe its behavior.

**Cloud** – deals with virtual devices, cloud architecture, and data only available on the cloud. Traditional forensics often relies on having access to the physical devices, but in cloud forensics, the data to be investigated resides in a virtual instance. Since you can't really turn off the cloud, cloud forensics is usually performed in a live environment. However, when inspecting virtual instances, you can take a copy (also referred to as a snapshot) and perform a static analysis on it.

### Being a digital forensics investigator
Being a forensics investigator requires a range of skills. The role involves building a complete picture of the activity that has occurred in a digital environment and backing it up with evidence. A solid technical background is essential as evidence can be found in unexpected places. Analytical and creative thinking are also valuable skills for this role; it’s important for an investigator to challenge their own theories and limits to uncover the truth!
