# Presenting Your Findings

## Quick Summary
Once you've collected, examined, and analyzed the evidence, you should create a complete report including your findings and details about how the evidence was handled.

### Keeping a record
If you don't like presenting a slideshow, imagine presenting evidence in court! In a courtroom, you may be required to present your findings from an investigation. These findings must be water-tight, as the opposition may try to invalidate them. Reporting is also important during the post-incident activity of an incident response plan. Incident responders should document the evidence as it will be needed if a court case is opened as a result of the investigation. 

It's crucial to record every action you take throughout an investigation on any evidence found at the crime scene or during an indecent. That includes the acquisition, examination, and analysis of data. Without a record of how you handled the evidence, you can’t guarantee its integrity or security, and your findings will not be taken seriously.

### Types of presentation

#### Written
The most common way to resent your evidence in both law enforcement and DFIR is to write a report. As a digital forensic analyst, you will need to create a full report of all the evidence relating to the case. When writing the report, it is important to consider the following: never make assumptions about the evidence, only state the facts. Record the timestamps for when you acquired the evidence. Timestamps are closely followed to see when the events took place. Keep the report clear and concise, and leave no room for ambiguity. The report must be appropriate for all audiences (both technical and non-technical). 

There is no de facto structure of a digital forensic report, but the following is an example of what the report should contain: 

* Title page – the first page of the report.
* Table of contents – a list of all section titles and page numbers.
* Overview – a high-level overview of what the report intends to cover.
* Evidence – a list of all the evidence that has been found.
* Objectives – what you intend to investigate.
* Forensic analysis – the steps taken and the chain of custody.
* Findings – the initial conclusions from the analysis of each item of evidence.
* Conclusion – conclusions about the evidence after the analysis.
* References, glossary, and appendices – a list of all the references at the end (as with every report), a glossary of technical terms, and any other documents or images referenced in the report.
 
#### Chain of custody form
In law enforcement, you must present a chain of custody form in addition to a report. This should include information like the name and signature of the investigator, dates the evidence was accessed, and how the evidence was transferred between different facilities or investigators. 

The chain of custody form is required by law, to prove that the evidence has been handled legally, and only by authorized members. If evidence was intercepted or tampered with by an unauthorized party at any stage during the investigation, it would be inadmissible in court. Inadmissible evidence can compromise the entire case, which is why it's so important to protect and preserve the evidence as much as possible.

#### Verbal
Besides providing a written report, you may be asked to testify on the stand in court as an expert witness. An expert witness is different from a lay witness (someone who actually witnessed the events). As an expert witness, you'll need to answer questions and provide your opinion based on your technical expertise. An expert witness can provide their objective, unbiased “expert” opinion about the evidence presented in court, even if they're not familiar with the case. 

### Tools
Writing a report with all the findings can be a lengthy and tedious task, but there are tools that can save you time and generate case reports with a click of a button. For example, Autopsy has a report generation feature that can be used to report all the digital evidence acquired or just selected parts. You can generate reports in different formats such as HTML, Excel,  KML (for reporting coordinates used for Google Earth views), STIX (for threat intelligence), and TSK body (for creating a timeline).
