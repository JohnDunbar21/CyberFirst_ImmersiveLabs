# Digital Evidence

## Quick Summary
Every time you interact with a device, you leave behind little bits of information that can be traced.

### What is digital evidence?
Digital evidence can be any digital data stored or transmitted by electronic devices. You can find it in any type of device, including computer hard drives, mobile phones, and smart devices. Digital evidence comes in many forms and can be hidden everywhere.

#### What is digital evidence used for?

Just like traditional physical evidence, digital evidence is used in court cases to help the jury decide whether to prosecute the criminal or not. But it's a lot more challenging to work with than traditional evidence. When a digital device is involved in a crime, it's not always easy or obvious to find digital evidence. There are no specific places to look, so an investigator must perform a full analysis of the device.

Attackers will usually try to delete the files associated with their crimes once they gain access to the device, and sometimes data can be lost if the device loses network connection or is turned off.

Due to its fragile nature, digital evidence must be handled with care. If it's not handled correctly, vital evidence could be thrown out in court on a technicality, leaving a criminal to walk free.

Digital evidence is also helpful in the private sector, where it can be used to investigate a cyberattack or an insider threat.

### Locard’s Exchange Principle
Digital evidence is just as traceable as physical evidence. Locard's Principle says this best:

**With every contact between two items, there will be an exchange of material**.

This also applies to digital communications. Just like leaving your fingerprints on a door handle when you enter a room, every time you log in to an account or access a website, you leave a digital trace behind. This means there's no perfect digital crime for criminals.

### Sources of digital evidence
Digital evidence comes in various forms and can be summarized by the following categories:

**Computer systems**: traditional computer hardware such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), universal serial buses (USBs), random-access memory (RAM), and graphics processing units (GPUs).
**Communication networks**: any digital information transmitted from one device to another through wired or wireless means, such as the internet, telephone systems, and local networks.
**Embedded systems**: any microprocessor-based hardware systems such as smartphones, tablets, cameras, IoT devices, printers, vehicles, and drones.

Different sources of digital evidence have different natures.

**Non-volatile evidence** would remain available on the device even if it's shut down. Examples include files or folders saved on a computer, such as personal documents, images, videos, and even system files and logs.

**Volatile evidence** focuses on the runtime state of the device. Anything that lives in memory (RAM) will no longer live in the same state when the device is restarted. To get around this, investigators often collect memory dumps to analyze, which include copies of the processes, network connections, and other volatile data stored in RAM.

**Metadata** (data about data) is hugly valuable as evidence because it contains information about files, such as the author, the date created and modified, and more.

### Chain of custody
When handling digital evidence in law enforcement, you must ensure that the evidence's collection, transfer, and disposition are documented. This proves that the evidence remains the same as the one discovered at the crime scene. A chain of custody is a collection of documents that tell how evidence was handled. The defendant could take advantage of mishandled chain of custody records and challenge the evidence in court, potentially making it inadmissible.

### Guidelines for handling digital evidence
When handling digital evidence, forensics experts must adhere to some rules. Although they aren't enforced by the law, it's highly recommended to follow the best practices.

#### ACPO guidelines
The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) provides guidelines for law enforcement and organizations investigating cybersecurity incidents and criminal activity. The guidelines set out four main principles:

**Principle 1**: No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court. 
**Principle 2**: In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions.
**Principle 3**: An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the same result.
**Principle 4**: The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.

To put it simply – data can't be changed in any way. Investigators work on copies of the evidence so that the original data can be considered a reliable piece of evidence. You must have a valid reason to access the original data. Always keep records of your processes and findings, and be sensible and considerate when handling digital evidence.
