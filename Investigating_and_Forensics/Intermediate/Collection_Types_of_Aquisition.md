# Collection: Types of Acquisition

## Quick Summary
Not all evidence is the same, and there isn’t only one way of acquiring it. In this lab, we'll look at the difference between copying and imaging data, the image formats that evidence comes in, and the types of acquisition.

### Acquiring digital data
Once you've identified and prioritized what you want to collect, it’s time to get your hands on the evidence and acquire a copy of it. 

#### Imaging and copying
In the past, acquiring digital evidence mainly focused on hard drives, floppy disks, and CDs, and was known as **disk imaging**. These days, evidence can include phones, removable media, cloud storage, and more. The original evidence should not be worked on; you should always aim to create copies of it using specialist tools, where possible. Although copying and imaging are similar, there are some technical differences between the two. 

**Copying** is similar to copying a file from one folder to another on your computer or to removable media and cloud storage. You could copy the complete drive, but this method won’t get you the data required for forensics analysis as you can’t drag and drop a whole operating system. Copying will only give you the part of the hard drive that's currently “in use,” and anything unused will not be acquired.

**Imaging**, on the other hand, will mirror the hard drive bit by bit, generating a complete replica of all its contents. Some forensics artifacts, such as deleted files, reside in the “unallocated” (or unused) space and can’t be acquired via copying. This means they're only available if you image the drive. In most cases, you want those artifacts to be able to restore deleted or lost data that could contribute to the investigation.

#### Image formats
When imaging a drive, there are several output formats that you can acquire. Below are some of the most commonly used formats with their file extensions:

* **Raw** – raw bit by bit copy of the data. (`.dd`, `.raw`, `.image`).
* **Expert Witness Format (EWF)** – a popular format supported by many tools such as FTK Imager. Also known as EnCase file format (`.e01`, `.ewf`).
* **Advanced Forensics Format (AFF)** – an alternative image format that has been proposed to be the standard (`.aff`, `.afd`, `.afm`).
* **Virtual hard disk file** – these are images of virtual hard drives generated by virtualization software. Extensions include `.vhd` and `.vmdk` (from VMware).
* **Hex dumps** – represents the contents of collected evidence as binary files in hexadecimal.

### Types of acquisition

#### Storage device (hard drive and flash drive) acquisition
This type of acquisition is about collecting data from a device’s non-volatile storage drive. The target device can be switched off, and its hard drive can be extracted. This is where you would use imaging techniques in combination with write blocker tools, where possible, to acquire a copy of the evidence without modification. 

In cases where you don’t need to acquire a full copy, you can also selectively acquire specific files of interest. A few disadvantages of this are if the hard drive is encrypted, it can be difficult to read or examine anything from it. Also, no volatile data is saved if the device is turned off, meaning that network connections or anything else stored in memory won’t be available for collection or examination. 

#### Volatile memory (RAM) acquisition
There are a few things to consider when dealing with memory acquisition. Volatile data such as running processes, memory records, network data, and other artifacts that are not saved on a hard drive are typically stored in random-access memory (RAM) and require live acquisition. 

When acquiring memory data, the output file is known as a **memory dump**. Similar to other acquisition types, you can choose to acquire a full copy of the memory or acquire only parts of it. Volatile memory can also be acquired in different formats. Some of the most popular ones include `.dd` (raw), `.vmem` (VMware), `.ewf` (Expert Witness Format), `.dmp` (dump files such as Windows crash dumps), and `LiME` (Linux Memory Extractor). 

Collecting volatile evidence is a very fragile process, as even the smallest change can alter the data. Sometimes memory acquisition tools can overload the system, overwrite processes, and cause other unpredictable situations, which makes this type of acquisition quite the challenge.

#### Mobile device acquisition
In mobile acquisition, you have several options to acquire and analyze a mobile device. Logical acquisition is considered to be the easiest method. You can extract the data available on the device using forensics tools, but you can’t acquire any data that has been removed. Similar to other storage devices, you can selectively acquire artifacts from the device, such as contacts lists, messages, or photos. You can also acquire the device’s file system structure and contents or even a copy of the device’s physical memory. Acquiring physical parts of mobile devices typically means that you might have to open and remove a memory chip, also known as chip-off extraction, which can be risky and requires special equipment. 

#### Remote acquisition
Sometimes, the target device might not be accessible for physical acquisition. Instead, you might need to acquire the information by gaining remote access to it. This type of acquisition has its challenges because the device must remain switched on, and there’s a higher chance that you'll accidentally modify the evidence since using write blockers is not feasible. 

#### Other device acquisition
Computers or mobile phones are not the only sources of evidence. There are several things that we use in our daily lives, such as cars, security systems, smart speakers, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices which all have some sort of electronic storage that holds potentially valuable data. Acquiring and examining this data can be difficult, depending on the device. It’s also not as simple or straightforward to copy the data over. Sometimes, you might need to destroy or disassemble devices to access the storage. 

#### Social media acquisition
There's a lot of information out in the wild that can also serve as evidence. Active members of any social media platform often share information such as contacts, friend lists, locations they've visited, pictures, and other media that can contain useful clues. In cases like this, you can use open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques and collect evidence that's publicly available.
