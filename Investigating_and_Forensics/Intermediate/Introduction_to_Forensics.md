# Introduction to Forensics

## Quick Summary
This lab is going to put you in the shoes of a Forensic Investigator and help you think like one. It requires you to understand tools, think critically and consider scenarios and perspectives 'outside of the box' before coming to a conclusion. 

Digital forensics is the process of interpreting and uncovering electronic data. With regards to the cyber industry, digital forensics is a relatively new field, arising with the need to understand metadata – essentially the data's data.

Digital forensics teams are typically considered CSI teams; however, large organisations and enterprises also have forensics specialists as part of their CSIRT or cyber security department. Digital forensics teams focus on the integrity of evidence during an incident as well as the integrity and meticulousness of the methodologies used. 

Being a Forensic Investigator involves using certified forensic tools and methodologies (for evidence acquisition) and reporting – which is necessary for anything to be credible in court. It is important that Forensic Investigators make validated copies of evidence (for investigation and testing) and never tamper with original evidence. 

To get an idea of how to think like an investigator, check out slides 11-14 from the linked DefCon presentation on digital forensic methodology.

### Five steps that should be followed as a Forensic Investigator:

* Gather useful items and items of potential worth as evidence
* Preserve data integrity (chain of evidence)
* Identify evidential artefacts as well as physical and critical information
* Analyse evidence
* Present evidence

### Analysts' Potential Additional Goals:

* Extract instant message logs
* Recover deleted files
* Memory analysis
* Convert identified persons of interest into common usernames (instant message, personal email account, etc.)
