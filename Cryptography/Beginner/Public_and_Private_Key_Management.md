# Public and Priavte Key Management

## Quick Summary
Cryptographic keys play an important part in the operation of cryptography and are used across a broad range of systems and applications in enterprises. Proper management of cryptographic keys is essential to the effective use of cryptography for security.

### What Is Key Management?
Key management is the process of managing a key throughout its lifecycle, including its secure environment, storage, distribution, and usage. Keys may be managed manually, but in most cases, an automated system is required to oversee, automate, and secure the key management process. An automated system that performs key management is commonly known as (cryptographic) key system management.

### Why Is Key Management Important?
A cryptographic key is as important to a computer’s security as a physical key is to a locked door or a combination is to a safe. If an adversary knows the combination or owns the key, a strong lock provides no security to its contents.

Poor key management can cause the compromise of even the strongest cryptographic algorithms, causing a complete loss of confidentiality and leading to encrypted data being compromised.

### How To Manage Private Keys
Private keys must be kept both secure and confidential. There are numerous ways to keep private keys secure on a computer system, and the best solution depends on the user's needs. Two possible methods of securing private keys include:

1. Encrypting the private keys themselves and storing them in a password-protected folder. An attacker would need to first brute force the password of the folder then brute force the decryption of the private keys. The breach would have (hopefully!) been identified and eliminated before the adversary gets to using the keys, and the cryptographic keys can be regenerated and re-secured.
2. Storing the private key in hardware where possible, such as a hardware security module (HSM) which provides tamper-resistant secure storage. An HSM provides two layers of security:
    a. The keys are physically protected because they are stored on a locked-down appliance in a secure location with tightly controlled access.
    b. The keys are logically secure as they are typically password-protected or encrypted.

### How To Manage Public Keys
Most commonly, in asymmetric cryptography, a user’s public key encrypts messages prior to transmission, protecting the confidentiality of the data. Only the user with the corresponding private key would be able to decrypt the message sent and ensure it's confidentiality. This is because a user’s public key is used to encrypt data, not decrypt it. It is possible to decrypt the data using the public key, however this only provides integrity of the data, not confidentiality.

Therefore, public keys do not require as much security protection as private keys. They can be managed with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), allowing users and systems to verify the legitimacy of certificate-holding entities and securely exchange information between them.

Alternatively, a user’s public keys can be made available for anyone to use, or simply given out to any user who requests them. Online, users have been known to add their public keys to email signatures, forum posts, or in their social media profiles.

### Maintaining Key Security
Maintaining the security of keys is an important process for all organizations to practice to prevent any data from being compromised. A common practice is the frequent rotation of keys. This is similar to the frequent changing of passwords to ensure they remain secret; by frequently switching passwords, you ensure any old ones are no longer usable if they are ever exposed. By frequently regenerating private keys, you ensure that keys remain fresh and prevent unauthorized users from using old keys to access systems.

Furthermore, you can protect private keys by maintaining an inventory, keeping them up to date to avoid cryptographic vulnerabilities, and ensuring they use the latest cryptographic algorithms.

In all aspects of key security, it’s highly important to securely delete keys once they’ve expired. If old keys remain active on a system, they could be unintentionally used to expose authenticated systems. Deactivating and deleting old or unused keys will help to avoid the risk of accidental compromises in the future.
