# What is Encoding?

## Quick Summary
Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another. There are several types of encoding, including image, audio, video, and character encoding.

### What is encoding?
**Encoding** is a method of converting data from one format to another, so it can be appropriately (and safely) used by a different system. This could include sending binary data over email or viewing special characters on a webpage. The goal of encoding is to ensure that information is communicated correctly and is therefore readable by a system.

Character encoding, for example, makes it possible for computers to “read” text by converting each text character (which includes all letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces) into binary code. For us to be able to read this text data, there are a few steps involved. Firstly, we need to know what type of encoding was used to store it. Then, we can then use the same method to interpret the binary data and retrieve the original text format. 

The purpose of encoding is not to keep information confidential. For this reason, it does not protect or secure data. As a result, the transformation of data from one format to another uses a publicly available system that can be used to quickly reverse data back to its original form. Unlike encryption, encoding does not require a key; to decode data you only need to know the algorithm used to encode it.

Some examples of encoding methods include binary, hexadecimal, and ASCII.

### How does it work?
Computers can only read one language – binary code. Binary is a two-symbol system, consisting of 0s and 1s, that makes up all the raw data stored on our machines. This means all data going into a computer needs to be transformed (encoded) into a series of 1s and 0s. This process is called serialization. However, serialization must be completed so that the computer receiving the data can easily convert the encoded format back to its original form.

When being stored in a computer, data will be encoded into a byte stream (binary). Once the computer has read this back, the data will be decoded from binary and displayed onscreen. This means whenever data is encoded, it can only be read (and thus opened by) a program that supports that specific type of encoding. With audio and video files, for example, this is often accomplished by a codec, short for "coder-decoder" – an encoding algorithm used to compress media data that is decoded and decompressed when played back. 

Many text editing programs support various types of text encoding. However, if a program does not support the encoding used in a text file, some or all of the characters may appear as strange symbols rather than the intended text.

Therefore, when you click on a file, your computer selects the required bytes from your hard drive, and all the information is decoded into the appropriate format, based on the extension of the file. For example, a file with the extension .mp3 would tell the computer that it contains audio. Audio files can be stored in a variety of different formats, including MP3, WAV, and AIFF. Other file formats include JPG (for image files), MP4 (for video files), and TXT (for text files).

### Encoding and encryption
Encryption and encoding are terms often used interchangeably, but this is not necessarily correct. While encryption does involve encoding data, it's only used when data has already been encoded to maintain confidentiality and security. Encoded data, on the other hand, is not confidential.

Encryption aims to transform data so that it's only accessible by the intended recipient(s). An example of this would be sending someone a private message that only they can read or securely sending a password over email. Whereas encoding focuses on making data readable (and useable), the goal of encryption is to keep data private and unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient(s).

### How and why is it used?
Encoding is an essential part of our everyday lives, as it transforms binary data from computers into a form that's readable by required systems. Encoding formats are vital, as they give computers (and us) protocols to comprehensibly view and process raw binary data.

Encoding data can also allow us to compress files into smaller formats to save disk space. This is useful when storing media files, as encoded media files are typically similar in quality to their original uncompressed version but have much smaller file sizes. An example of this would be a MPEG (.MPG) compressed video file. This format only requires a fraction of the disk space that the original digital video (.DV) file demands.
