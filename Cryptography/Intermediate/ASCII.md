# ASCII

## Quick Summary
ASCII is a code for representing 128 characters as numbers. Computers use ASCII to represent text data, which makes it possible to transfer data from one computer to another. In this lab, you will use CyberChef to encode and decode using ASCII. 

### What is ASCII?
Computers operate using numbers and therefore need a way to convert letters (and other characters) to and from numbers, so they can be stored and manipulated. An encoding standard known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which debuted in 1963, is used for this purpose. The code represents 128 characters as numbers, with each character assigned a number from 0 to 127. The standard ASCII character uses seven bits for each character.

ASCII contains the upper and lower case letters of the English alphabet, crucial punctuation markers, mathematical symbols, and 33 control codes for data transfer and text formatting.

The following characters are grouped like so:

0-32 and 127 – control codes for data transfer as well as spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
48-57 – digits (numbers).
65-90 – upper case letters.
97-122 – lower case letters.
33-47, 58-64, 91-96, and 123-126 – punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, brackets, and other key characters.

### ASCII table
Each letter is assigned a value according to its position within the ASCII table:

In the table it demonstrates what the ASCII is and the plain text equivalent. There are four large columns and within those 4 columns there are 4 small columns representing Dex Hex Oct and Char. This shows how ASCII is converted to plain-text.
There is also an extended ASCII table that contains an additional 128 characters, bringing the total to 256, which can be viewed here.

### How does it work?
All computer data is stored as numbers, which means a computer must transform any characters (such as those pressed on a keyboard) into numbers to process them. ASCII is the mapping process that assigns each character to a number. For a character to display on the screen, the computer memory must read its ASCII number and "draw" it as a glyph. 

### How and when is ASCII used?
All ASCII-capable applications (like word processors) can read or store text information to and from computer memory. Without ASCII, modern computing would be more complex and less streamlined.

ASCII code provides a common language across all computer operating systems to establish this link between the screen and hard drive. This means, regardless of the software installed on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux), you'll be able to read documents, as every software recognizes the binary equivalent of the characters on-screen.

Files using ASCII can also serve as a common denominator for all types of data conversions. For example, if a software program cannot convert its data to another format, both programs can still input and output ASCII files. This makes data conversion possible, even when the two software programs are incompatible.
